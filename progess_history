create class ReadMapCV2 to load img using OpenCV python libary -> for open file with scaled map (maps for proccesing
create class MapTileCutter uwing paert class ReadMapCV2 with method get_file_id





 ------------------------------------
 TODO: 
 new class to cut the images:
 - choose the ocjects from the map and save them to image for computer vision/DL


future problems:
- quality of the map (my current files are find in internet)
- the size of full scale maps -> cutting the area, doing anaysis on cut part of map -> next part of map need to cover a little of prvious one -> someone needs to be stored the "pixel cooeds" of the slices
- maps with not white background
